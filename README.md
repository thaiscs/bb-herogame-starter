# The Faceless Men Game

Dear Teachers,

In order to make this assignment fun I had this idea of building the start of my own game - The Faceless Men Game - which was inspired by my love for the series Game of Thrones.

You will notice that the game guidelines and pictures I rendered to page are related to that, but without compromising the academy game logic and respective tests, which all passed :)
